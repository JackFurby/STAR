Scrabble Turn Automation Robot is a solver to scrabble. It will be able to give accepted words when given a set of characters.

## Data structure

### Trie

A trie is a data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Each node will have a key who's value will be based on its position. This will be such that nodes before node X will be the prefix and nodes after will become the suffix. The root node is the empty string In this project a trie data structure will be used to store accepted words in a format that is efficient to search.

#### node

A ternary search tree is made up of nodes linked together. Each node is made up of a **string**, **indicator** and **pointers**. It is possible for there to be 26 pointers however this is not space efficient and therefore another approach may be used in my implementation.

A word is represented by leaf nodes and by some inner nodes that are marked as accepted words.
