# STAR

Scrabble Turn Automation Robot is a solver for scrabble. Once complete it will be able to find the best move you can make given a board and a set of tiles.

## Data structure

### Trie

A trie is a data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Each node will have a key who's value will be based on its position. This will be such that nodes before node X will be the prefix and nodes after will become the suffix. The root node is the empty string In this project a trie data structure will be used to store accepted words in a format that is efficient to search.

#### node

A trie is made up of nodes linked together. Each node is made up of a **value**, **indicator** and **pointers**. In my implementation the value is called data, indicator is called end and pointers are children.
* The indicator is used to mark the current node as the end of a word.
* The value stores the current word. This is not required but will save time if you want to return the word found.
* the pointers can be seperated out but in my implementation I have used a dictionary as it means I can store as many unique keys as I like and will not be taking up any extra storage for unused pointers.

```Python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, end=False, data=None):
		"""Initilise the node."""
		self.end = end
		self.data = data
		self.children = dict()
```

A word is represented by leaf nodes and by some inner nodes that are marked as accepted words.

## Words

Word list file can be found here: https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/sowpods/. This is a SOWPODS Scrabble word list.

## Adding words to trie

When adding to the trie the start point is the trie head. From here the trie is traversed until either a node is not present in the current node children or the current character being checked is the last letter in the word being added. If the node is not present then a new node is added. If the current character being checked is the last letter in the word being added then the node is edited to say it is then end of a word.

```Python

def addWord(self, word):
	"""Add a word to the trie."""
	currentNode = self.head

	for i in range(len(word)):
		# if letter already exists in children move to the node
		if word[i] in currentNode.children:
			currentNode = currentNode.children[word[i]]
			# if letter is then end of word being added update node to show this
			if i == len(word) - 1:
				currentNode.end = True
				currentNode.data = word
		# if letter is not in children add it
		else:
			if i < len(word) - 1:
				currentNode.children[word[i]] = Node(False)
			else:
				currentNode.children[word[i]] = Node(True, word)
			currentNode = currentNode.children[word[i]]

```

## Finding all words from a list

wordSearch will recursively call itself and on each call will check to see if the current node is the end of a word. To make sure the same path is not searched twice a list of current letters searched is kept. If a letter is already present in this then that letter is skipped. The method here is not perfect and if you enter a wild card then you may get duplicates in your result

Given a list of characters wordSearch will return a list of all words that can be created with them.

This function has also been extended (not shown here) to accept a prefix, suffix or an extra string that must be included in the results.

```Python

def wordSearch(self, letters, currentNode=None):
	"""Given a list of letters find all words that can be made."""
	# list of all words found
	words = []

	if currentNode is None:
		currentNode = self.head

	# if word found then add it to words
	if currentNode.end:
		words.append(currentNode.data)

	if len(letters) is not 0:
		# i keeps track of current letter
		# searched stop duplicate searches if input has repeated letters
		i = 0
		searched = []
		for letter in letters:
			if letter not in searched:
				searched.append(letter)
				if letter in currentNode.children:
					newLetters = letters.copy()
					del newLetters[i]
					words += self.wordSearch(newLetters, currentNode.children[letter])
			i += 1

	# return words found
	return words

```

## Environment

STAR has a complete environment to represent Scrabble (WIP). It has various abilities with the current offerings being:

```

\q			-	Exit STAR
isAccepted		-	Enter a single word to find out if it is accepted or not
findWords		-	Find all words you can make with a given set of characters
findWordsPrefix		-	Find all words you can make with a given set of characters + a prefix
findWordsSuffix		-	Find all words you can make with a given set of characters + a suffix
findWordsContains	-	Find all words you can make with a given set of characters + a set string
findMoves		-	Find all words you can make with a given player and the board
board			-	Display the current state of the board
letters			-	Display the current letters available to take
makePlayer		-	Makes a new player (max 4)
playerLetters		-	Prints the letters a given player has
playTurn		-	Make a move for the current players turn
activePlayer		-	Print the current active player

```

Over time some of these will be removed in order to only allow legal moves. Following from the data structure section of this project isAccepted, findWords, findWordsPrefix, findWordsSuffix and findWordsContains allow interaction with the word trie. All other actions will interact with the game environment.


### playTurn

The option playTurn allowa the current active player to enter a word to place, starting position (X and Y) on the board and word direction (right or down). This input will be checked with the game rules and if legal will be played and the player updated with a new score and tiles. The environment will then move onto the next player. Once all tiles have been given to players and a player runs out of tiles the game will end. After each go the board will be updated and shown on the UI.

### UI

STAR has a basic UI. For now (and possibly always) the UI will only show the current board state. To interact with the enviroment you will need to use the command line interface.

### findMoves

Find moves will return almost all playable moves a player can make taking into consideration their tiles in their rack and the current state of the board. Some basic notes about how to do this are as follows:

* Scan the board looking for starting positions (positions next to tiles that have already been played)
	* For each stating position add one tile from the players rack at a time in the direction of the tile that the position is next to (extending the current tile). Each time a word is found take note of it.

findMoves was based of the algorithem used in [The Worldâ€™s Fastest Scrabble Program](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf).

Currently words are found by extending right or down on starting positions. It also has the ability to move the starting position up or left by 7 spaces. This results in almost all possible moves being found. The only situation where words are not found are when placing parallel words starting before (above or to the left) of a starting position.
